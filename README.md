# RemoteRoot - Jobs Board
_This project is a work-in-progress and is part of my journey toward becoming a job-ready developer._

RemoteRoot is a personal front-end project built to test and showcase my skills as a frontend developer.  
It fetches and displays real-time remote job listings using the [Remotive API](https://remotive.io/api).

## ðŸ“± Current Functionality
- makes a call to the api upon start
- lists the available jobs
- displays jobs based on user Search
- displays further job details and option to Apply
  
## ðŸš€Desired End-Result
- Lists remote jobs dynamically from an external API
- Allows users to search and filter jobs by category or keyword
- Displays job details including title, company, location, and description
- Clean, responsive UI with dark mode support (if implemented)
- Smooth, modern user experience with transitions and interactivity

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **TailwindCSS** â€“ utility-first styling for fast, responsive design  
- **Remotive API** â€“ source of real-time remote job data
